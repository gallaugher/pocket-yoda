# pocket-yoda
Shake a CircuitPlayground + receive advice from Yoda. Great to add to a plush or 3D print.

This build was one of multiple test questions on an in-class Physical Computing exam. Students downloaded the yoda-soundsn folder & were tasked to: configure sound & the board's built-in accelerometer, generate a random number 0 - 8, play the soud corresponding to that number, and animate a green swirl effect (comet animation) while Yoda was dispensing advice, shutting off the animation when done.

When added to a plush, battery powered, and when given a louder speaker, it's a sort of "Yoda-style Magic 8-Ball".

Make any modifications that improve the code or experience? Let me know! Cheers! Prof. G.
